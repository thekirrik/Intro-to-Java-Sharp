 * Program:	Exercise13.cs
 * Date:	2019/03/19
 * Purpose:	 (Financial application: compound value) Suppose you save $100 each month
    into a savings account with the annual interest rate 5%. Thus, the monthly inter-
    est rate is 0.05/12 = 0.00417. After the first month, the value in the account
    becomes
    100 * (1 + 0.00417) = 100.417
    After the second month, the value in the account becomes
    (100 + 100.417) * (1 + 0.00417) = 201.252
    After the third month, the value in the account becomes
    (100 + 201.252) * (1 + 0.00417) = 302.507
    and so on.
    Write a program that prompts the user to enter a monthly saving amount and
    displays the account value after the sixth month.
